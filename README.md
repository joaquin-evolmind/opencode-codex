A clean, native multi-account Codex (ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth) integration for
[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Adds multiple-account support, account
switching, and per-account quota tracking — all through OpenCode's standard
flows instead of bespoke CLIs or custom dialogs.

> ### ⚠️ Use at your own risk
>
> This plugin lets you attach more than one Codex account to the same OpenCode
> instance. Depending on how you use it, that may run against the OpenAI Terms
> of Service. Only attach accounts that belong to you, and don't rely on
> rotation to dodge rate limits in a way that violates ToS.

## What it does

- **Multi-account OAuth.** Log in once per account through the standard
  `opencode auth login` → `openai` flow (browser / device code / paste
  callback URL). Each login adds another account.
- **Account switching inside the TUI.** `/accounts` opens a picker showing
  every connected account, its plan, and current 5h/weekly usage.
- **Standard logout flow.** Removing accounts is just
  `opencode auth logout` — each account appears as its own entry.
- **Automatic fallback.** Requests go through the active account; if it hits
  a 429/quota wall the next eligible account picks up so you don't have to
  babysit the switcher.
- **Live quota in the sidebar.** Two-tone progress bars for the active
  account's 5h and weekly windows, plus a pool aggregate when multiple
  accounts are connected.

## Installation

Before installing, it's recommended to log out of every Codex account
currently signed in to **OpenCode**.

```sh
opencode plugin add @insd47/opencode-codex
```

## Adding accounts

Run `opencode auth login`, pick **openai**, and choose one of the three OAuth
methods:

| Method                                    | When to use                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ChatGPT Pro/Plus (browser)**            | Local machine with a graphical browser. The plugin spins up a one-shot callback server on `localhost:1455`.            |
| **ChatGPT Pro/Plus (device code)**        | Remote / headless setup; enter a short code on another device that has a browser.                                      |
| **ChatGPT Pro/Plus (paste callback URL)** | Sandboxed environments where neither of the above works — you open the URL manually and paste the redirected URL back. |

Every successful login is appended to the account store and becomes the active
account. Repeat for additional accounts.

## Managing accounts

<img width="1135" height="680" alt="account switching" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a8856a1-333e-4be3-a677-dde164f40ea8" />

| Action | Where                          |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Add    | `opencode auth login` → openai |
| List   | `opencode auth list`           |
| Switch | `/accounts` in the TUI         |
| Remove | `opencode auth logout`         |

Under the hood the plugin keeps a `openai/<email>` entry in `auth.json` per
connected account and keeps the canonical `openai` key as a compatibility
mirror — so OpenCode's provider system sees a normal OAuth credential while the
plugin reads the account pool from OpenCode's standard auth store. Selecting an
account in `/accounts` is persisted, so the request process uses it even when it
runs separately from the TUI. Fallback priority is stored independently.

## Quota display

The sidebar shows two sections when multiple accounts are connected:

- **Quota** — the active account's 5h and weekly windows, with a reset
  countdown and percent remaining.
- **All Quota** — pooled aggregate across every connected account, so you can
  see how much headroom your set has overall.

When only one account is connected, just **Quota** is shown.

Usage data is fetched in memory from `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage`:

- once on TUI startup,
- on every `session.idle` event (debounced),
- and every 5 minutes thereafter.

## Storage

| Path                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth.json`           | OpenCode's credential file and the source of truth for Codex OAuth tokens. One entry per account at `openai/<email>` plus the compatibility mirror at `openai`.         |
| `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/codex/preferences.json` | Fallback priority (`accountOrder`) and the explicit `/accounts` choice (`selectedAccount`). Changing one never changes the other. |

Quota and temporary rate-limit state are process memory only. They are refreshed
again after restarting OpenCode. Before each request the plugin checks whether
`auth.json` or `preferences.json` changed and reloads them only when they did.

## Troubleshooting

**`/accounts` says "No accounts" right after install.**
Make sure you've logged in at least once with `opencode auth login` → openai.
If you migrated from another multi-account plugin, your previous tokens won't
auto-import — log in again.

**Logging out via `opencode auth logout` and then chatting fails.**
Pick a different account with `/accounts`, or run `opencode auth login` again.
The plugin only restores the active mirror when there's at least one account
left.

**Sidebar shows `5h —` or `weekly —`.**
Usage data hasn't been fetched yet. It populates on the next idle event or 5
minutes after startup. If it stays blank, your active token may be revoked —
re-authenticate.
